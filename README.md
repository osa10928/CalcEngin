# CalcEngine Application

This repo is my first Java repo and serves as my introduction to the Java programming language. It features a non dynamic calculator which takes hard coded input within the Main class and outputs the calculations.

## Requirements
This application was built using Java JDK 10:
`java version "10" 2018-03-20`
`Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10+46)`
`Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10+46, mixed mode)`


## Running Application
The application comes with a .jar file contained in the filepath `/out/artifactsCarEngine_jar`. The file can be used to run the hardcoded calculations within the Main.class file. 

## What I Learned
Many other classes are written into the calcengine package which go unused in the Main.class file but served to teach and provide examples of java fundamentals such as:

* Constructors
* Inheritence
* Overloading
* Interfaces

The application also helped me become used to using my IDE of choice Intellij provided to me by the people fo JetBrains.


## Special Thanks
I would like to send a thanks to [Pluralsight](pluralsite.com) for providing me with the instruction especially Jim Wilson who provided the instruction for the class. I would also like to thank the JetBrains for providing me with the free non commercial IDE to aid me in my Java development.
